							<h2>Hey! I am Bibi!</h2>
							<p>I am a PhD student in Astronomy & Astrophysics at <a href="https://astro.lu.se/" target="_blank">Lund Observatory</a> in Sweden, and 
								I work in the wonderful field of exoplanet atmosphere characterisation. 
								More precisely, I spend my time looking at light coming from stars and I try to isolate
								the signal of the planetary atmospheres of planets orbiting these stars by applying the cross-correlation technique 
								(<em>Never heard of that? Don't worry about it! Feel free to ask, or look at this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9aXndF73wE&feature=youtu.be" 
								target='_blank'>cool explanation video</a> made by my supervisor. 
								Or just skip that part and think of me as a little wizard magically removing the star from my data **puff**, and gone.</em>).
								<br>
								<br>
								The topic of my PhD is the characterisation of ultra-hot exoplanet atmospheres using high-resolution spectroscopy,
								where I try to not only discover what these atmospheres are made of, but also try to undestand why certain planets 
								seem to be different than others. I work under the supervision of <a href="https://hoeijmakers.github.io/" 
								target="_blank">Jens Hoeijmakers</a> at Lund Observatory in Sweden,
								and have - as of now - mostly focussed on analysing observations of ultra-hot Jupiters with high-resolution spectrographs 
								on ground-based telescope. Only recently, I published my first first-author paper in Nature Astronomy (see 
								<a href="#research" class="more scrolly">Research</a> below), where we investigated the atmosphere of the ultra-hot Jupiter 
								WASP-189 b, and detect titanium oxide along many other elements as consituents of its atmosphere, as well as chemical inhomogeneity
								most likely due to dynamics. All in all: Very exciting, check it out!
								<br>
								<br>
								Prior to that, I obtained my master's degree in Physics at <a href='https://ethz.ch/en.html' 
								target='_blank'>ETH Zurich (ETHZ)</a>. During my master's thesis, I had a closer look at exoplanets that were detected 
								by the radial velocity method and tried to predict their detectability using the METIS instrument on the ELT - 
								good catch, this instrument is not up and running (yet), but theoretical predicitons are always a good thing ;). 
								My thesis was supervised by <a href='https://quanz-group.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.MTY1MzQ3.TGlzdC8zNDM1LDM4MTg3MjY0MQ==.html' 
								target="_blank"> Prof. Dr. Sascha Quanz</a>, the head of the research group for <a href='https://quanz-group.ethz.ch/' 
								target='_blank'>Exoplanets and Habitability</a> at ETHZ.

								<h2>Research</h2>
							</header>
							<p style="text-align: left;">
							In my research, I aim at building a better understanding - let's say insight - into the world of ultra-hot Jupiters. These worlds 
							are far from what we'd ever expected to exist, and they never fail to surprise us with new unresolved riddles. 
							Throughout my first project, I have been working on high-resolution data of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-189 b, an ultra-hot Jupiter
							orbiting its host star in the constellation of Libra. Though observable from both the northern and the southern hemisphere, the star is just
							a bit too faint to be observable by naked eye, but hence constitutes a very bright target for observations with high-resolution
							spectrographs. In my first paper, we published the detection of the nine chemical species in the atmosphere of this ultra-hot planet
							together with variations in the detections that we attribute to dynamics and layeredness. <br>
							<br>
							Lately, I have started collaborating with Elspeth Lee from the University of Bern, who published a GP-accelerated MCRT code for three dimensional
							radiative transfer in exoplanet atmospheres. As part of her paper, I produced mock observations that predict the detections of water and CO in the 
							emission spectrum of WASP-77 A b. This collaboration has gotten me very interested in creating mock observations, and I am currently following 
							this little new fascination on the side.

							<h2>Teaching</h2>
						</header>
						<p>As part of my studies, I have been teaching students on different levels, but also for different subjects.  
							Here you can find all the teaching materials for the courses I have been teaching in the past. 
							Note that the courses taught at ETH Zurich were held in German, so the material is naturally also provided in German. 
							Translations upon request.<br>
							<br>
							Teaching has always been dear to my heart, and if it wasn't for astronomy and all its beauty and fascination, 
							I'd have become a high-school teacher right after school. Learning about teaching theory and how to translate them 
							into practise is very important to me, as well as that my materials are used by following generations. So if you feel like
							you'd like to use something for your own courses, please do not hesitate to contact me. So much time went into preparing certain
							scripts, exams and exercises, it would be a shame if they weren't passed along. 
						</p>

						<h3>Teaching at Lund University</h3>
						<p>
							Since the start of my PhD, I got the opportunity to engage in teaching in different ways, 
							such as supervise labs for students at different stages of their studies. 
							Recently I got the opportunity to supervise the computer lab on exoplanets detection in 
							ASTC01 (Astrobiology) at Lund University where I guided students through experimenting with 
							the radial velocity and transit technique to search for exoplanet. Further I got the chance 
							to teach a computer lab in FYSB21 (Mathematical Methods for Vibrations, Waves and Diffusion) 
							on heat diffusion.
						</p>
						
						<hr>
						<h3>Previous teaching at ETH Zurich</h3>
						<p>
							During my studies at ETH Zurich, I was involved in teaching undergraduate students in physics, mathematics, interdisciplinary sciences, 
							chemistry, and medicine as part of their introductory physics courses. Both normal exercise classes (weekly classes with exercise sheets
							as well as theory) and exam preparation courses (intensive course just before the exams) were part of my teaching experience at ETH Zurich. 
							The material is in German. I am happy to give you access to the tex files of the exam preparation courses: The more people use it and improve it,
							the more students benefit from it! Shoot me a message if you want access to something specific. Happy to share!
						</p>
						<strong>Award for Excellent Teaching 2020</strong>
						<p>
							While teaching Physik II for first year Bachelor students in mathematics, physics and interdisciplinary 
							sciences (with physics / chemistry focus) in spring 2020, I was awarded the VMP Assistentenaward (in German) 
							for excellent teaching assistance in spring semester 2020, by the association of mathematics and physics students 
							of ETH (VMP)
